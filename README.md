# Illuminating Your Path

## Listen Up

Artificial Intelligence is NOT the future.  

I know, I probably sound crazy! But... hear me out. With the recent hype of AI, it’s seen as something that’s going to change the world for the better (or worse, who knows!) But history does repeat itself, and if we analyze technological trends of the past, we might just be able to predict the future.

## A Look in the Past

Let’s take cryptocurrency for example. Bitcoin first launched in 2009. As of now, cryptocurrency is very popular and has already gone through its hype. But back then, buying the currency was very problematic because there was no platform that let you buy Bitcoin easily.  

Brian Armstrong created Coinbase, which is now one of the most popular software available when it comes to purchasing crypto. The most shocking part? He founded the company back in 2012, long before the hype surge of Bitcoin took place.  

The main reason he figured this out early was because he followed his heart. You have two options: either follow your heart or follow the crowd. If you follow the crowd, you're too late in the game. But, if you follow your heart, you will be early!  

And picking something up earlier definitely comes with its advantages. Brian’s company is now worth a whopping **40 billion dollars**! All because he followed his heart when he saw a vision. But besides the monetary value, I can guarantee you he has a sense of fulfillment doing it (after all, he has gone through an IPO).  

## Tying it Together

But enough about Bitcoin, let’s get back to the juicy part: **AI**.  

How does this apply to Artificial Intelligence? Has Artificial Intelligence gone through the same trend? When OpenAI released ChatGPT, the hype of AI began. Even to this day, there are numerous AI startups, and investors are pumping money into them to collect all the monetary benefits from this trend.  

But the beauty of starting a company is that you won’t thrive for very long if you are starting it on the base of a trend. Eventually, the “follow the crowd” AI startups will fail.  

Although OpenAI released ChatGPT around two years ago, OpenAI was founded by Sam Altman in 2015. Similarly to Brian, Sam decided to avoid the hype going around at the time and chose to follow his heart. Elon Musk, one of OpenAI’s early investors, said that OpenAI was such a small company, and he never thought that this small company could even come close to competing with its biggest competitor at the time, Google.  

But, because Sam wasn’t motivated extrinsically but rather intrinsically, he managed to outcompete Google, which is insane if you ask me.  

## What is the next BIG THING?

So, what is your heart telling you to do? Is it telling you to pick up that hobby that you have always wanted to? Or maybe that hobby that you picked up but abandoned for a while now?  

Be honest with yourself.  

With all honesty, I was very scared of writing this post. But I wrote it because it has been something I’ve wanted to do for a long time. And I did it.  

I guarantee you, after you’re done, you will feel more fulfilled.
